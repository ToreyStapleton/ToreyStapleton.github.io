Javascript has a set of operators called [bitwise operators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Bitwise_Operators#Bitwise_AND).  They perform operations on binary representations of their operands, which are treated as a sequence of bits (zeroes and ones).  I had never needed to use bitwise operators until I recently discovered practical usage for the `~` operator from a coworker.

`~` is the NOT operator.
